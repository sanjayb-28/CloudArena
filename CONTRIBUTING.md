# Contributing to CloudArena

Thanks for your interest in helping build CloudArena. This document outlines the processes and guidelines we follow to keep collaboration efficient and respectful.

## Code of Conduct

Our community is governed by the principles in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. By participating you agree to uphold these standards.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports:** Describe the expected behavior, what happened instead, and detailed reproduction steps.
- **Feature requests:** Explain the problem you want to solve, why it matters, and how you envision success.
- **Pull requests:** Start by opening an issue or discussion so we can co-design the approach, then link your PR to the tracking issue.

## Development Workflow

1. Fork or clone the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Run applicable formatters, linters, and tests locally before pushing.
3. Include or update tests for your changes when practical.
4. Add documentation updates if behavior, configuration, or public interfaces change.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear summary, implementation notes, and validation evidence.

## Commit and PR Guidelines

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) when possible (e.g., `feat: add adaptive planner interface`).
- Keep pull requests focused; split unrelated work so reviews stay quick.
- Reference issues in commits or PR descriptions using `Fixes #123` or `Refs #123`.
